## The specific business problem revolves around the inadequacy of the current lending strategy, which is not sufficiently informed by comprehensive insights derived from LendingClub loan data. The institution struggles to assess borrower behavior and market dynamics effectively, resulting in challenges such as inaccurate risk identification, difficulties in predicting loan default rates, and the inability to dynamically adjust lending criteria to respond to evolving market conditions. ##

#  Business Requirements  #
## The business requirements involve the establishment of a robust data analytics framework that can extract meaningful insights from LendingClub issued loans data. This framework should enable the financial institution to gain a deep understanding of borrower behavior, identify high-risk segments, predict default rates accurately, and provide the necessary foundation for real-time adjustments to lending criteria. Additionally, the solution should be scalable, adaptable, and capable of integrating with existing systems to ensure seamless implementation ##
