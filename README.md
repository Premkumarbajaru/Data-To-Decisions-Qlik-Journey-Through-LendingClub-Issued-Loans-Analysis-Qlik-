This framework should enable the financial institution to gain a deep understanding of borrower behavior, identify high-risk segments, predict default rates accurately, and provide the necessary foundation for real-time adjustments to lending criteria. Additionally, the solution should be scalable, adaptable, and capable of integrating with existing systems to ensure seamless implementation ##
